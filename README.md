Wordle - Java to Web Port
This project is an implementation of the popular game Wordle, originally developed as a console application in Java for my Web Development degree. To showcase my full-stack skills and growth, I have created a Web version so the game can be played directly in the browser, while also including the original backend logic.
Note: While the documentation is in English, the code comments in the Java backend remain in Spanish as they were part of the original academic submission.

📂 Project Structure
java-backend/: Contains the core game logic in Java (OOP, file handling, ANSI color logic).
resources/: Original .txt files used by the Java version for the word dictionary and game history.
index.html & styles.css: The functional web version that replicates the original logic for a better portfolio visualization.

🚀 Technologies Used
Java: Object-Oriented Programming, Scanner, and Files management.
HTML5 & CSS3: Responsive design and game grid layout.
JavaScript: Replication of the Java logic engine (letter validation and color algorithm).

🎮 How to Play
Console Version: Can be executed via the Main.java file within the backend folder.
Web Version: Simply open index.html in any modern web browser to start playing.

🛠️ Git Configuration (Best Practices)
To keep the repository clean, the following files and folders are ignored:
.idea/ (IntelliJ configuration)
out/ (Compiled Java files)
*.iml (Project modules)

Project developed by Lucía LV as a demonstration of integrating backend logic with modern frontend development.
